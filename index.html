					<p><b>ArXiv</b></p>
					<h4>Abstract:</h4>
					<p> Despite the tremendous progress made by deep learning models in image semantic segmentation, they typically require large annotated examples, and increasing attention is being diverted to problem settings like Few-Shot Learning (FSL) where only a small amount of annotation is needed for generalisation to novel classes. This is especially seen in medical domains where dense pixel-level annotations are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose Regularized Prototypical Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (R-PNODE), a method that leverages intrinsic properties of Neural-ODEs, assisted and enhanced by additional cluster and consistency losses to perform Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) of organs. R-PNODE constrains support and query features from the same classes to lie closer in the representation space thereby improving the performance over the existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based FSS methods. We further demonstrate that while many existing Deep CNN based methods tend to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks, R-PNODE exhibits increased adversarial robustness for a wide array of these attacks. We experiment with three publicly available multi-organ segmentation datasets in both in-domain and cross-domain FSS settings to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. In addition, we perform experiments with seven commonly used adversarial attacks in various settings to demonstrate R-PNODE's robustness. R-PNODE outperforms the baselines for FSS by significant margins and also shows superior performance for a wide array of attacks varying in intensity and design.</p>

					<p><b>6th International Conference on Data Science & Management of Data (CODS‑COMAD’ 23)</b></p>
					<h4>Abstract:</h4>
					<p> Mathematical expressions are required not only for numerical calculations but also for discussions and documentation. They play a significant role in providing clarifications and disambiguation of ideas, concepts and definitions. Software engineering artifacts such as source code, documentation and bug reports have mathematical expressions in them. Our experiments, with a commit message generation tool, suggest that mathematical expressions present in the input data affect the tool's accuracy. To help future research in this direction, we have constructed and shared a dataset of bug reports with both automated and manually annotated mathematical expressions. We have also shared a tool (MEDSEA) to identify mathematical expressions. Our data set contains 2,040,120 bug reports from 10 different projects. We have used our tool to annotate all of these bug reports. From each project, we have also manually annotated 1000 bug reports. We annotated the dataset with the objective of developing toolkits to identify mathematical expressions in software engineering artifacts. Finally, we have made a case for future work to deal with mathematical expressions when improving software engineering tasks, especially those that use bug reports.</p>

					<p><b>25th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI '22)</b></p>
					<h4>Abstract:</h4>
					<p> Few-shot Learning (FSL) methods are being adopted in settings where data is not abundantly available. This is especially seen in medical domains where the annotations are expensive to obtain. Deep Neural Networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This is even more severe in the case of FSL due to the lack of a large number of training examples. In this paper, we provide a framework to make few-shot segmentation models adversarially robust in the medical domain where such attacks can severely impact the decisions made by clinicians who use them. We propose a novel robust few-shot segmentation framework, Prototypical Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (PNODE), that provides defense against gradient-based adversarial attacks. We show that our framework is more robust compared to traditional adversarial defense mechanisms such as adversarial training. Adversarial training involves increased training time and shows robustness to limited types of attacks depending on the type of adversarial examples seen during training. Our proposed framework generalises well to common adversarial attacks like FGSM, PGD and SMIA while having the model parameters comparable to the existing few-shot segmentation models. We show the effectiveness of our proposed approach on three publicly available multi-organ segmentation datasets in both in-domain and cross-domain settings by attacking the support and query sets without the need for ad-hoc adversarial training.</p>
